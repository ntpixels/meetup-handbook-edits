The WordPress [your-town] Meetup Group is for any WordPress user - new or experienced - who wants to learn more about WordPress, network with other users and developers, and discuss all things WordPress.

We host three free meetups a month that address topics aimed at:

• Beginners just starting out

• People using WordPress for their business and website

• More experienced users who want to do more with WordPress

• Technical-minded developers, designers, and freelancers

Our monthly meetups can help you get the most out of this amazing open source software whether you use WordPress as a developer, designer, business, or blogger, 

Our meetups are free to attend. This is all thanks to our incredible sponsors.

We would love for you to be a part of our welcoming, active and enthusiastic group. Please join us and come to the next event!
